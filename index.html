    <h2 id="about">About Kohli</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Virat Kohli </strong>(born 5 November 1988) is an Indian cricketer
      who currently captains the India national team. A right-handed top-order
      batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world. He
      plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL),
      and has been the team's captain since 2013. Since October 2017, he has
      been the top-ranked ODI batsman in the world and is currently 2nd in Test
      rankings with 886 points. Among Indian batsmen, Kohli has the best ever
      Test rating (937 points), ODI rating (911 points) and T20I rating (897
      points). Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19
      World Cup in Malaysia. After a few months later, he made his ODI debut for
      India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a
      reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a
      regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the
      2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of
      "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa.
      Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for
      the first time in 2013, Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format,
      winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014
      and 2016). Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012
      and handed over the Test captaincy following Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Test
      retirement in 2014. In early 2017, he became the limited-overs captain as
      well after Dhoni stepped down from the position. In ODIs, Kohli has the
      second highest number of centuries and the highest number of centuries in
      run-chases in the world. He holds the world record for being the fastest
      batsman to 10,000 and 11,000 runs in ODI cricket, reaching the milestones
      in 205 and 222 innings respectively.

    <p>
      In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri
      Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour,
      Kohli had played only eight List A matches.[45] So, his selection was
      called a "surprise call-up".[46] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both
      first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured,
      Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series.[47] He made his
      international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and
      was dismissed for 12.[48] He made his first ODI half century, a score of
      54, in the fourth match.[48] He had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other
      three matches.[48] India won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI
      series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[49][50] After the postponement
      of Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the
      injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests
      against Australia A in September 2008.[51] He batted only once in the
      two-match series, and scored 49 in that innings.[52] Later that month in
      September 2008, he played for Delhi in the Nissar Trophy against SNGPL
      (winners of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan) and top-scored for Delhi in
      both innings, with 52 and 197.[53][54] The match was drawn but SNGPL won
      the trophy on first-innings lead.[54] In October 2008, Kohli played for
      Indian Board President's XI in a four-day tour match against
      Australia.[55] Kohli, after recovering from a minor shoulder injury,
      returned to the national team replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the
      Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[56] He batted at number 4
      for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj
      Singh.[57] In the group match against the West Indies, Kohli scored an
      unbeaten 79 in India's successful chase of 130 and was awarded man of the
      match award.[58] Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven-match home
      ODI series against Australia, appearing in two matches.[59] He found a
      place in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored
      27[60] and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who
      regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury
      recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely.[61][62] Kohli
      returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI
      century–107 off 114 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third
      wicket with Gambhir, who made his personal best score of 150.[48][63]
      India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1.[48] The man of the
      match was awarded to Gambhir who gave the award to Kohli.[63] Tendulkar
      was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January
      2010,[64] which enabled Kohli to play in each of India's five matches.[65]
      Against Bangladesh, he scored 91 to help secure a win after India
      collapsed to 51/3 early in their run-chase of 297.[48][66] In the next
      match against Sri Lanka, Kohli ended unbeaten on 71 to help India win the
      match with a bonus point having chased down their target of 214 within 33
      overs.[67] The next day, he scored his second ODI century, against
      Bangladesh, bringing up the mark with the winning runs.[68] He became only
      the third Indian batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd
      birthday, after Tendulkar and Suresh Raina.[69] Kohli was much praised for
      his performances during the series[70][71] in particular by the Indian
      captain Dhoni.[72] Although Kohli made only two runs in the final against
      Sri Lanka in a four-wicket Indian defeat,[73] he finished as the leading
      run-getter of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of
      91.66.[74] In the three-match ODI series at home against South Africa in
      February, Kohli batted in two games and had scores of 31 and 57.[48]
